## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end data pipeline on Microsoft Azure.
It ingests data from SQL Server, stores it in Azure Data Lake Gen2, transforms it with Azure Databricks, and organizes it into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

The processed data is then loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for advanced queries, and insights are visualized through Power BI dashboards. Security and governance are implemented with Azure Active Directory and Azure Key Vault.

---

## Architecture

The data pipeline consists of the following key components:

Ingestion → Load data from SQL Server into Azure Data Lake Gen2 via ADF.

Storage → Raw data stored in Bronze Layer.

Transformation → Databricks cleans and enriches data into Silver and Gold Layers.

Analytics → Data prepared for querying in Synapse.

Reporting → Visualized through Power BI dashboards.

Security → Managed with Azure AD & Key Vault.

---

## Features

End-to-end data pipeline using Azure services.

Scalable storage and processing (ADLS Gen2 + Databricks).

Bronze/Silver/Gold layered architecture.

Analytics with Synapse serverless SQL views.

Interactive reporting with Power BI.

Enterprise-grade security with Azure AD & Key Vault.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

Azure Subscription

Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Lake Gen2

Azure Databricks

Azure Synapse Analytics

Power BI
---


## Note

The project is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates cloud-based data engineering.

You can extend it by adding logging, monitoring, or CI/CD automation.
---


## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/azure-data-engineering.git
cd azure-data-engineering
```

### 2. Set up Azure resources:
- Create Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen2, Databricks workspace, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI workspace.
- Configure Azure Key Vault for securing sensitive information.

### 3. Upload the provided `.ipynb` files to your Databricks workspace.

### 4. Execute the SQL scripts in your SQL Server or Azure Synapse Analytics environment.

### 5. Mount your Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage by running the `StorageMount.ipynb` notebook.

## Azure Services Used

- **Azure Data Factory**: For data ingestion and orchestration.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: For storing raw and processed data.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data transformation and processing.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For analytics and querying.
- **Power BI**: For reporting and visualization.
- **Azure Active Directory**: For security and access control.
- **Azure Key Vault**: For managing secrets and credentials.

---

## Implementation Details

### Data Transformation
- **Bronze to Silver**: Raw data is cleaned and enriched. Refer to `Bronze to Silver.ipynb`.
- **Silver to Gold**: Analytical datasets are created. Refer to `Silver to Gold.ipynb`.

### SQL Scripts
- SQL scripts for setting up serverless views and additional transformations are located in the repository.

### Data Lake Mounting
- The `StorageMount.ipynb` notebook contains code to mount Azure Data Lake Gen2 for seamless access.

---

## Usage

1. Start by running the `StorageMount.ipynb` notebook to mount the Azure Data Lake.
2. Run the `Bronze to Silver.ipynb` notebook for initial data transformation.
3. Execute the `Silver to Gold.ipynb` notebook to prepare analytical datasets.
4. Use the SQL scripts to create views in Azure Synapse Analytics.
5. Connect Power BI to Synapse Analytics for real-time reporting.
